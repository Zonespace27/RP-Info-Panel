# Roleplay Info Panel

A mod for Minecraft Forge that allows for players to create a roleplay profile for themselves that other people are capable of viewing. As the name would suggest, this is primarily for roleplay servers.

## Use

To use the mod, follow the following steps:

- Install the mod on both the server and the client.
- Once in-game, open your info panel with the "Open RP Info Panel" button (`'` by default) and modify what you wish. Exiting the menu will automatically save any changes you made.
- To open someone else's panel, simply hit the "Open RP Info Panel" button while looking at their player.
